# PCA-Dogs

Required programming language: Python (Python3 needs to be installed on the computer)

Required libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn (sys library is used to exit if the file path is incorrect)
(os library is used to dir the folder)

The program consists of the main file (mainPCA.py) and the file that includes the PCA class (PCA.py). Additionally, a notebook 
file (notebookPCA.ipynb) also added to ease the readiness of the code.

How to execute: If the libraries are not installed, use the command 'pip install x' in the command window.
From the terminal/command window run mainPCA.py with the command 'python mainPCA.py'. It is needed to input the file 
locations/directories of the image folder and the original image path, respectively. If the directory is wrong, the program ends.
Example paths are: 'C:\Users\gulce\Desktop\EEE 8TH SEMESTER\CS 464\Homeworks\HW2\afhq_dog' for the image folder and
'C:\Users\gulce\Desktop\EEE 8TH SEMESTER\CS 464\Homeworks\HW2\afhq_dog\flickr_dog_000002.jpg' for the original image path.
For the notebook, it can be opened with Jupyter or Google Colab.

Outputs: The program will display PVE values, PVE graphs, PC images, and reconstructed images. The plots are displayed at the
end of the program.

To rerun the program, it is needed to close all the plot figures.
